      <p>We have been involved in many software projects as a part in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Degree of Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering. The main problem we are facing in this process is proper tracking of the project. Sometimes supervisors are not available and when they are available students are not available. Mostly when deadline is near students somehow manage to complete the project but, supervisor has no knowledge who did what and how much tasks.</p>
